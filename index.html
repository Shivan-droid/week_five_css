          <ul>
            
            <li>Sports- One of my biggiest past times is getting involved in sports. The competetion and adrenaline help you forget the other stressor you may have in life. Even after playing for hours and getting exhausted, the break after is always very relaxing </li>
             <li>Arts- Another one of my hobbies is creating various forms of art. This involves creating music, taking interesting pictures, making something absurd on photoshop and so on.</li>

            <p>I am a Interactive Media Design student currently in my first semester. I am very new to the back
               end of the computer. I have no prior knowledge of coding, but seeing as the world progresses it is
                becoming a more valubale skill. Not only in terms of employment opportunity but also in terms of 
                understanding these devices we interact with every day.</p>


            <p>A year that changed the planet, 2020 was a interesting one. As the year comes to an end I find myself
              reflecting on the pandemic, my honest thoughts are it was poorly handled by most governments. A pandemic
              at this scale is not unlikely with the global human lifestyle, some have said we were lucky the virus was
              not as deadly as some other viruses we have faced. Regardless, we have to take the matter seriously because
              the next virus may be worse and planning ahead can make a major difference in the outcome.</p>
